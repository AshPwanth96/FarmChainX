ðŸŒ¾ FarmChainX â€” Smart Agriculture Platform (Work in Progress)

FarmChainX is a backend project built using Spring Boot that aims to digitalize the agricultural supply chain by connecting farmers, buyers, and suppliers on a single platform.

The goal of the project is to make farm trading easier, transparent, and efficient â€” allowing farmers to upload their products, buyers to place orders, and admins to monitor activities â€” all through secure APIs.

We are building this as a full-featured backend system with user authentication, product management, and order handling. The project follows a clean three-layer architecture (Controller â†’ Service â†’ Repository) and uses JWT for secure user access.
